# Regular-Expressions

## Match method
re.match(pattern,text) -> searches for the pattern only in the beginning of the string. 

This [file](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Regular-Expressions/blob/main/RegularExpressionOperations-match.ipynb), covers the following topcis - 
  - Difference between raw string and python string. 
  - match method in re library
  - how to write unit test 
  
## Search, findall,finditer and groups
re.search(pattern,text) -> returns the first match in the text.
re.findall(pattern,text) -> returns a list of all the matches.
re.findieter(pattern,text) -> returns an iterator

This [file](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Regular-Expressions/blob/main/RegularExpressionOperations-search%2Cfind_all%2Cfind_iter%2Cgroups.ipynb),covers the following topic - 
  - search method in re, and how its different from match
  - findall mehod
  - finditer, and how it covers up the possible disadvantage of findall
  - groups, and how we can name the groups.

## Find and replace, Split
re.sub(pattern, replacement pattern / function, text) -> returns the text where the string matching the pattern is replaced by a string given by the replacement pattern / function 

[This file](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Regular-Expressions/blob/main/RegularExpressionOperations-Find%20and%20replace%2C%20split.ipynb) covers the following topic- 
  - using re.sub with a pattern 
  - using re.sub with a user defined function 
  - re.split
